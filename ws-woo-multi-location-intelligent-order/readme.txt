== Description ==

This is a simple plugin that adds a shipping zone column in the orders administartion menu.
It displays in that column the zone name based on postal codes.

To make this plugin work.
Suppose you have two or more warehouses and you need to know which is the right warehouse to ship your products based on shipping address postal code.
This intelligent order plugin will make this happen. First you need to create shipping zones based on postal codes. Give them a unique name.
Add any shipping methods and costs as you like. Now you are able to see the shipping zone that an order belongs.
It works with new and old orders.

This plugin doesn't have any configuration page. The only configuration needed is the description above which belongs to the
woocommerce core functionality.

Full woocommerce compatible.

== Installation ==
Plugins are utilities which provide additional functionality to your application. 
To install a plugin you just need to put the plugin files into the wp-content/plugins directory. 
Once a plugin is installed, you may activate it or deactivate it from the Plugins menu in your WP administration.

The easiest way of installing a WordPress plugin is to use the plugin search. 
The only downside of this option is that a plugin must be in the WordPress plugin directory which is limited to only free plugins.

In WordPress 2.7 and above you can install plugins directly from the admin area. 
Download the plugin to your computer, then log in to your WP admin area and go to Plugins > Add New.
Browse to the plugin archive and select it. Then click Install Now and the plugin will be installed shortly.
